I modeled my signal processing in Python with the builder design pattern, to validate my digital design. The builder pattern in the digital design models helped the team to model other blocks, or re-model my design in the future. To facilitate the usability of my models and validations, I also provided the websites for documenting the tools during the developments.  During the integration, I designed a tool for Verilog automatic connection using Python and other scripting languages.  The tool can detect the connection between dierent blocks, and generate a higher level structure that connects each individual blocks. With this tool, the high-level block generation is automated without the risk of introducing manual errors."

To re-evaluate the feasibility of malware detection using Hardware Performance Counters (HPC), I measured the HPC traces on various programs, including 1,000 malware and 1,000 benignware. To perform the measurements, I used Rabbitmq to orchestra the communications in a cluster of machines.  During the experiments, I modified the GRUB boot loader to reset the disk image after every malware experiment. I performed data analysis on these HPC values using various machine learning algorithms, such as K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and Random Forest (RF). By applying these machine learning algorithms, I evaluated the robustness of malware detection using cross-validations."

Traditional testing/validation techniques, for example, power and timing validation methods, are not able to detect HTs. Our group collaborated with optical imaging group to develop optical-backside imaging. I worked as the support for the IC design, data-processing in this project. I engineered optical structures in standard cells, and designed hardware watermarks in the ICs to detect any modifications made by the intruders. After designing the optical structures, I used various data processing, such as correlations, noise analysis, and machine learning, to elevate the HT detection accuracies. With these engineered structures, we can perform classications between dierent kinds of standard cells, such that any modifications or replacement to these cells can be easily detected through optical imaging."

The implemented cryptographic algorithms included symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, and secure hash functions. I also integrated our cryptographic engines with the OpenSSL library to inherit the library's support for block cipher modes. At the same time, the FPGA implementation of cryptographic operations was more exible compared to custom hardware implementations of cryptographic components."

The evaluation server browsed the website, deleted the cookies and visited the website for the second time.
